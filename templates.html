<!-- Accessibility of event -->

<section id="excessibility">
	<h2>Accessibility</h2>

    <p>
		You can roll right into the role=drinks venue!
		There is an elevator to take you to the second floor—and quite possibly also back down again.
		Guide animals—be it dogs or dinosaurs—are also welcome.
		There is a park right outside where you can walk your dinosaur to go poop.
    </p>

	<p>
		A Dutch sign language (<abbr title="Nederlandse Gebaren Taal" lang="nl">NGT</abbr>) interpreter will be present for the lightning talks.
		We do ask you bring your own interpreter for the socialising part of role=drinks.

    <h2>Who is running this shtick?</h2>

    <p><a href="https://twitter.com/detonite">Job</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/EvaWesterhoff">Eva</a>, and <a href="https://twitter.com/MichielBijl">Michiel</a> somehow convinced people to come to a bar to drink free beer and talk about accessibility—how strange.</p>
